## 🚀 Introduction

**Time Manager** is a powerful, offline, and privacy-focused productivity app designed to help you focus on your studies and work. Whether you use the **Pomodoro technique**, need a stopwatch for **Study Sessions**, or want a rigorous **Exam Mode**, this app has it all.

Built with ❤️ using Flutter, it is optimized to run smoothly in the background, even on devices with strict battery optimization (like MIUI/Redmi).

## ✨ Features

### ⏱️ Multiple Timer Modes
- **StudyWatch:** A simple stopwatch to track your daily study hours.
- **Pomodoro:** Classic 25m/5m focus technique with customizable rounds.
- **Exam Mode:** A strict countdown timer for simulating real exams.

### 🔔 Smart Notification System
- **Sticky Mode Toggle:** You choose! Keep the notification permanent (to prevent accidental swipes) or dismissible.
- **Background Service:** The timer keeps running even if you close the app.
- **Redmi/MIUI Fix:** Includes a dedicated **"EXIT APP"** button in the notification to forcefully stop the service on stubborn devices.

### 📊 Analytics & Insights
- **Detailed Graphs:** Visualize your study trends (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).
- **Streak Tracker:** Keep your learning streak alive!
- **Subject-wise Breakdown:** See which subject you studied the most.

### 🎨 Customization
- **Themes:** Custom colors for Study, Break, and Exam modes.
- **Sounds:** Choose your favorite alarm and ticking sounds.
- **Privacy First:** All data is stored locally on your device. No internet required.
